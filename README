The code consists of three parts: View Synthesis, Renderer and GUI. View synthesis stores a model of the network presented in OAVS paper 
with the implementation of the inference phase and MATLAB wrapper around it. Renderer allows rendering of provided light field
image based on the selected synthetic aperture parameters including perspective shift and refocusing. Finally, GIU allows communication
with an instance of the Renderer class by setting the parameters of the synthetic aperture and visualization of the rendered image.

Requrements:
- Python (View Synthesis)
- Python modules:
  - numpy
  - torch
  - torchvision
  - opencv-python
- MATLAB (GUI)
  
  
The code was verified on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04.
Tested using Python version 3.6. The moduels were
installed using pip, e.g.
  pip install torch.
The version of the required moduels at test time were:
  opencv-python 4.4.0.42
  torch         1.6.0
  torchvision   0.7.0

Tested on MATLAB R2018b and R2020a. Note MATLAB supports
Python version 2.7, 3.5 and 3.6
(https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/427187-problem-with-python-numpy).

One can make a new environment in Anaconda and execute in terminal
>> source activate conda_environment
>> matlab
which should set approapriate installed python environment for MATLAB.
