- Python modules:
  - numpy
  - torch
  - torchvision
  - opencv-python
- MATLAB (GUI)
  
Tested using Python version 3.6. The moduels were
installed using pip, e.g.
  pip install torch.
The version of the required moduels at test time were:
  opencv-python 4.4.0.42
  torch         1.6.0
  torchvision   0.7.0

Tested on MATLAB R2018b and R2020a. Note MATLAB supports
